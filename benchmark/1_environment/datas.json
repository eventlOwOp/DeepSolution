        "solution": "This paper proposes an ultra-low emission retrofit plan for 3 × 150 t/h coal-fired boilers. Specifically, firstly, considering the challenge of high original nitrogen oxide emissions, low-NOx combustion retrofit technology is applied to the boiler, reducing the original NOx emissions to 140 mg/m³ (standard) through water-cooled air chambers, secondary air systems, and water-cooled wall replacement, and achieving a compliant emission of 45 mg/m³ after SNCR. Secondly, addressing the issue of significant fluctuations in SO2 emissions, the limestone automatic feeding system is improved to enhance feeding timeliness and control accuracy, enabling SO2 emissions of no more than 28 mg/m³ with in-furnace desulfurization alone. Lastly, to tackle the problem of excessive dust emissions, new ultra-low emission filter bag dust removal technology is employed, achieving compliant dust emissions with concentrations below 8 mg/m³ (standard) by replacing the filter bags.",

        "solution": "This paper proposes a calibration platform solution for the accuracy of the urea metering pump based on a miniature oval gear flowmeter. Specifically, first, considering the issue of low accuracy of the urea pump, the use of miniature oval gear flowmeter technology improves the calibration accuracy through highly precise flow measurement. Secondly, to address the challenge of inaccurate measurement caused by strong pulsation and backflow phenomena, the \"weight reduction\" method is adopted. By calculating the flow in the liquid suction and return pipelines, the urea injection quantity is accurately measured, ensuring real-time calibration with high precision.",

Specifically, first, considering students' strong willingness to recycle but the lack of supporting mechanisms, it adopts self-service dismantling point technology and campus volunteer supervision to improve on-site recycling efficiency by providing dismantling tools and monitoring. Second, addressing the issue of high business volume and high material recycling value but low recycling rates, it utilizes unmanned vehicle mobile recycling point technology and dormitory recycling cooperation, enhancing the circular use of high-value materials through a campus recycling network and convenient dormitory recycling points. Finally, to tackle personal privacy and safety concerns, the dismantling experience is optimized by introducing privacy protection measures within self-service dismantling points, thereby increasing participation and enthusiasm for recycling.",
