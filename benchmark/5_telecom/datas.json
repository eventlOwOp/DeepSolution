Secondly, addressing the high complexity of basic operations in the GF(2^163) field, techniques such as fast modular reduction and modular squaring combined with modular reduction are utilized to optimize modular reduction and squaring expansion operations, significantly reducing the number of read and write operations. Lastly, considering the performance issues caused by the high complexity of inversion operations during scalar multiplication, a modular inversion operation based on the extended Euclidean algorithm combined with LD projection coordinates and the Montgomery algorithm is employed. This approach reduces the number of inversion operations and optimizes point addition and doubling calculations, effectively improving overall computational efficiency. Experiments show that on an 8-bit AVR microprocessor, the optimized scheme completes a GF(2^163) field ECC point multiplication operation in approximately 0.70 seconds, reducing runtime by 7.8% to 38.6% compared to existing schemes and being more resource-efficient.",

    "requirement": "Design and Practice of 5G Network Deployment Along High-Speed Rail Lines In the high-speed rail operating environment, deploy a 5G network that meets high-capacity demands and offers excellent continuity for full coverage, addressing issues such as Doppler frequency shift caused by high-speed movement, frequent handovers, and capacity bottlenecks in densely populated user scenarios, while improving passengers' internet experience.",
    "solution": "This paper proposes a 5G deployment solution under the high-speed rail scenario. Specifically, firstly, considering the issues of Doppler frequency offset and frequent handovers in the high-speed rail's fast-moving environment, Doppler frequency offset compensation technology and multi-RRU cell merging technology are used. Through signal demodulation optimization and reduction of handover frequency, the coverage stability is improved. Secondly, to address the high capacity demands brought about by high user density, 3.5GHz 32TR equipment is employed, which meets the high throughput requirements through multi-antenna arrays and high-frequency band selection. Finally, to address station spacing limitations and the issue of low-speed user occupation, the equipment coverage solution is optimized through link budget adjustments, while low-speed users are migrated out and high-speed users are prioritized, thereby improving resource utilization and the quality of 5G services for high-speed rail.",
