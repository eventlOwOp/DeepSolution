Specifically, first, considering the impact point deviation that may be caused by initial velocity and launch angle errors, real-time trajectory correction is achieved through strapdown laser semi-active guidance technology and circular micro-pulse thruster arrangement technology by detecting the target position in real time and adjusting the thrust via pulses. Second, to address the issue of inappropriate control initiation timing potentially affecting correction performance, control initiation timing adjustment technology is adopted, optimizing the initiation time (e.g., 3.8 seconds) to ensure the control system effectively participates in trajectory correction.

Specifically, first, considering the high impact load of up to 13,000g during cabin-arrow separation, which may lead to equipment performance failure or damage, rubber shock-absorbing technology is adopted. This technology achieves shock attenuation by absorbing and releasing impact energy through rubber damping elements. Secondly, in response to the requirement that the base frequency of the isolation system must meet 70 Hz < fn < 375 Hz, inherent frequency adjustment technology is used. By adjusting the thickness of the rubber pads (with H and B values respectively designed as 3 mm and 2 mm, 4 mm and 3 mm, 5 mm and 4 mm, etc.) and adding adjustment shims of different thicknesses (such as 0.5 mm, 1.0 mm, etc.), the system stiffness is adjusted and the inherent frequency optimized. Finally, in terms of experimental validation, shock testing and nonlinear evaluation techniques are adopted to verify the design effect. It is found that increasing the rubber thickness and adding adjustment shims can significantly improve the performance of the shock absorber, ensuring the adaptability of the design scheme in various installation-constrained environments.

        "solution": "This paper proposes a solution for the design of flight schemes and the study of modeling accuracy for lightweight small unmanned aerial vehicles. Specifically, firstly, to address the issues of large data volume and difficulty in image matching caused by low-altitude flights, low-altitude photogrammetry technology is used. By adjusting flight altitude (e.g., 60-100 meters) and image overlap rate (80% in the forward direction, 70% in the lateral direction), efficient data acquisition is achieved. Secondly, to address the issue of the spacing of ground control points potentially affecting modeling accuracy, an optimization technique for ground control point arrangement is adopted. By setting the spacing of ground control points to no more than 500 meters, the planar and elevation accuracy of the model are reliably maintained within 5 cm, while reducing the redundant work of point deployment. Finally, using model error evaluation techniques, the effectiveness of the optimized designs for flight altitude and ground control point spacing is validated through quantitative analysis of planar and elevation errors. This provides a reference for the application of lightweight small UAVs in engineering surveying.",

Specifically, firstly, considering that the limitations of aircraft mass and size may make it difficult for the design to meet range requirements, a Kriging surrogate model and a hybrid integer sequential approximation optimization algorithm were used to improve search efficiency through the construction of surrogate models and sequential optimization within a limited design space, achieving range enhancement. Secondly, to address the aircraft's need to meet harsh flight environments and various constraints, an improved adaptive Legendre-Gauss-Radau pseudospectral method was adopted to accurately solve the trajectory optimization problem by dynamically adjusting the number of collocation points. Finally, to address the issue of high time consumption during the optimization process, a locally enhanced EI criterion was used in combination with the global convergence and local search capabilities of the optimization algorithm, significantly reducing the number of surrogate model calls and improving computational efficiency. The final scheme achieved a 12.89% improvement in aircraft range capability while meeting multi-constraint flight requirements.",
