Additionally, there is a height difference of 5.8 meters in the north-south direction of the site. The site is connected to the urban road network only on the western side via Tanshan Avenue, while the other three sides are adjacent to the Tanshan Park scenic corridor. In terms of building height control, the buildings on the site must meet a height limit of ≤30 meters, with the total height control range near the eastern mountain red line requiring a reduction to ≤18 meters. Under these conditions, planning and design will face challenges such as restrictions on entrance and exit settings, complex traffic flow lines, difficulties in organizing medical functional zones, layout limitations due to height restrictions, and insufficient integration with mountain landscapes, which may result in consequences such as mixed vehicle and pedestrian traffic, intersecting medical flow lines, and uncoordinated architectural image."
