    "solution": "This paper proposes a comprehensive solution for the temporary support system of post-pour strips in stadiums. Specifically, first, considering the long time span required for supporting post-pour strips and the risks caused by concrete shrinkage, the PVC concrete column technology (technology0) was adopted to address the issues of material deformation and loosening due to the prolonged retention of traditional disc-lock supports. Second, based on the characteristic that the support load is transferred by the constructed structure, the bearing capacity verification technology (technology2) was used, and optimizations were made to the foundation below the columns and the slab bottom support setup to ensure construction safety. Third, to control cracks and deflection in three-sided supported slabs at post-pour strips, finite element analysis technology (technology3) was utilized to optimize the stress state of beams and slabs, thereby verifying slab usability. Finally, considering the adaptability of disc-lock steel pipe supports (technology1) in densely structured inclined stands and the cost-effectiveness of PVC column supports for secondary beams with ≥1.60m spacing platforms, the combined solution reduced total costs by approximately 870,000 yuan, achieving optimization of both safety and cost-effectiveness.",

Secondly, addressing the issues of sparse water systems and insufficient stormwater pipelines in urban construction areas, a combined road and pipeline drainage design is implemented, optimizing vertical elevation and road drainage paths (10 routes), with the construction of 104.3 km of new pipelines, effectively alleviating regional drainage pressure. Lastly, tackling the challenge of forced water drainage during extreme weather conditions, six pump stations are configured to ensure a forced drainage capacity of 50.7 m³/s through precise pump station scheduling. Furthermore, SWMM verification shows that the scheme can effectively cope with the conditions of a 30-year return period heavy rain superimposed with a 50-year return period storm surge, with no overflow points occurring, comprehensively enhancing flood control and drainage capabilities.",

Renovations are required for the exterior wall insulation, roof insulation and waterproofing, thermal insulation performance of exterior windows, and heat metering of the heating system for 16 buildings, while enhancing the energy efficiency and residential comfort through energy-saving technologies.",
    "solution": "This paper proposes an energy-saving renovation plan for an old residential community in Beijing, which includes the following specifics: Firstly, considering the poor thermal performance of the exterior walls, external wall insulation technology was employed. Using a rigid polyurethane board and cement mortar composite structure solved the issues of improved insulation performance and thermal bridge effects. Secondly, addressing roof leakage and heat dissipation problems, inverted insulation technology was applied. By combining rigid foam polyurethane boards with waterproof layers, dual functions of waterproofing and insulation were achieved. Meanwhile, to address the poor thermal insulation and inadequate airtightness of external windows, hollow glass window technology was adopted, replacing single-layer windows with 13 mm hollow glass windows, significantly reducing the window thermal transmission rate and enhancing sealing performance. Finally, to tackle heat waste and poor adjustability of the heating system, heat metering renovation technology for the heating system was implemented. By installing ultrasonic heat meters and balancing valves, precise heat distribution and regulation were achieved. Experimental results show that the energy-saving rates of the renovated exterior walls, roof, external windows, and heating system reached 53.5%, 58.6%, 67.4%, and 59.8%, respectively, indicating that the plan has excellent energy-saving and insulation effects, and can effectively enhance the residential comfort and energy efficiency of the building.",
