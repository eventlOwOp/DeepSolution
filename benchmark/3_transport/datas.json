        "solution": "This article presents a comprehensive design scheme for the renovation of the S322 Lu Zhou Expressway. Specifically, firstly, considering the need to avoid basic farmland and villages, which may face challenges in demolition and land coordination, a traffic prediction model and multi-scheme comparison technique were used to select the recommended alignment that complies with the overall planning and minimizes additional land use. Secondly, to address the potential increase in traffic loads, a comprehensive design scheme for the expressway and general road sections was implemented, ensuring service levels under future peak traffic through segmented design indicators of dual four to six lanes. Additionally, to solve the crossing issues of rivers along the route, bridge engineering techniques were adopted, with flexible bridge structure and span designs; for instance, the Qingshui River, which is 88 m wide, is supported by a trapezoidal section and prestressed box girder to ensure the stability of the bridge and foundation. Finally, to alleviate traffic throughput rates at complex junctions, a separated interchange optimization design was adopted, adjusting multiple intersections into more efficient combinations to ensure connectivity and rapid transit requirements.",

Under the conditions of having a free face at the edge, low landslide stability (especially under adverse conditions such as heavy rain and seismic activity), and weak and complex geological conditions in the landslide area, complete the stability analysis of the landslide and design a reasonable landslide treatment plan, ensuring that the final predicted value of landslide deformation is less than 25mm, thereby guaranteeing the safe operation of the highway.",
        "solution": "This article presents a design proposal for landslide stability analysis and remediation plans. Specifically, first, considering the characteristics of large surface elevation differences, steep slopes, and loose soil in the landslide area, a stability analysis using the transfer coefficient method is conducted to comprehensively evaluate the landslide's resistance to sliding and instability risks under natural conditions, heavy rainfall, and seismic events. Secondly, in response to lower stability under adverse conditions, a retaining wall support technology is adopted to enhance the stability of the slope by reinforcing the leading edge of the landslide to resist bending moments and sliding forces. Simultaneously, in light of the weak slope surface and the risk of instability at the edge, a grid of anchor rods is designed to enhance the structural strength of the slope surface for comprehensive support. Lastly, a deformation prediction model is established using a BP neural network, and analysis of 42 monitoring data points reveals that the landslide's deformation values are all less than the control value of 25 mm, and the deformation trend is convergent, verifying the rationality and effectiveness of the remediation plan, ensuring the safe operation of the road.",

        "solution": "This article presents a design plan for the Huangmei Port Huitong Dock based on the Yangtze River Protection Strategy. Specifically, first, considering the rapid growth of Huangmei Port's throughput demand and the significant gap, techniques for optimizing the overall layout of the dock and automated loading and unloading processes were employed. By reasonably distributing berths and implementing efficient, pollution-free systems, the dock's throughput was achieved at 7.82 million tons per year. Secondly, in response to the Yangtze River protection policies and local ecological environmental protection requirements, green and eco-friendly architectural design was adopted. By optimizing the foundations of hydraulic structures and environmental protection facilities, the project's impact on the environment was significantly reduced. Finally, to address operational issues under the complex water conditions of the Yangtze River, a floating dock structure was used, with four 3,000-ton-grade berths arranged along the flow direction to adapt to changes in water depth during flood and dry seasons, ensuring normal vessel operations and continuous port efficiency.

Specifically, first, addressing the current issues of the intersection of National Route 208 and Provincial Route 206, it considers that simply using a twisted approach or adding turning lanes cannot meet traffic demand and alleviate congestion under existing conditions. Therefore, the dual-T planar intersection technology is employed, reasonably distributing traffic flow through a 140-meter lateral connector, while also being small in scale and economically feasible. Secondly, considering that the peak hour traffic demand at the end of the service life exceeds 2733 pcu/d, with a significant proportion being traffic conversion demand, the issue of insufficient traffic capacity at circular intersections is addressed by adopting a simple interchange scheme. This is achieved through the design of directional ramps and the construction of overpass bridges, realizing efficient and conflict-free traffic conversion, further enhancing the service level of regional traffic. In the scheme evaluation phase, this paper not only focuses on technical and economic indicators but also incorporates indicators such as social and environmental coordination, public opinion compliance, and adaptability to sustainable development.

        "solution": "This article presents a comparative analysis of three overhead schemes (D-beam overhead line, portal pier overhead line, and large excavation after the line is cut off) and ultimately selects the large excavation after the line is cut off as the primary solution. Specifically, first, considering the conditions of limited train numbers and simple equipment on the Detian Railway, there may be challenges such as a long construction period and interference with railway operations. Therefore, the method of large excavation after cutting off the line is used, achieving rapid blocking of a 62-meter section of the line and safely carrying out large excavation operations to complete the jacking. Secondly, alternative options include the use of D-type low-height construction beam technology, which can achieve stable overhead construction without interrupting train operations but has a longer construction period. Lastly, the portal pier overhead scheme was also explored to further optimize construction efficiency and avoid the inconveniences and risks associated with manual pile drilling. Based on a comprehensive analysis of the three schemes, the large excavation method was chosen according to local conditions, as it involves significant equipment investment but minimizes the time affected on the railway, while also being competitively viable in the industry.",

        "solution": "This article presents an economically viable solution for the renovation of cross-line bridges under highway widening conditions. Specifically, first, considering possible structural waste and environmental impact, the assessment of bridge technical conditions and bearing capacity calculations were used to analyze the existing bridge structure, confirming that the piers and some spans meet the renovation requirements. Secondly, to address the deficiencies in net width and clearance after renovation, hollow slab beam prefabrication technology was employed to adjust the original span (from 17.75m to 21.5m), and a new Pier 3a was constructed using on-site concrete construction technology to ensure structural stability. Finally, to dismantle sections of the bridge spans that are no longer in use, a mechanical hoisting and static cutting method was adopted to avoid impact on adjacent spans and surrounding road traffic. The entire solution reduced the scope of demolition of the old bridge, saved on project costs, and shortened the duration of the impact on surrounding roads during the renovation.",

Specifically, first, considering the complex hydrological conditions of the plains and the limitations on the layout of railway bridges, which may lead to limited space for the hub layout, the original design scheme of the hub is further optimized using merging techniques for entrance ramps to reduce interference with mainline traffic and effectively utilize the reserved ramps from the first phase, achieving efficient connectivity of the hub layout. Secondly, to address the potential mismatch problems that may arise due to design requirements needing to meet both old and new standards, an optimized ramp layout and a new-old standards integration plan are adopted. Through semi-directional ramp merging design and curve radius optimization, the overall traffic service functions are enhanced, while avoiding the need for widening on existing bridges of the Changhe Expressway. Finally, given the precious land resources in the southern Jiangsu region and economic requirements, optimization techniques for the original scheme's engineering scale are employed, successfully controlling the additional land occupation to a small range while saving about 50 million yuan in investment costs.

Second, for conditions where the depth of deep soft soil is considerable and the geology is complex, either cement-stabilized piles or prestressed pipe pile solutions are chosen, particularly using prestressed pipe piles near bridge abutments. These piles, with a wall thickness of 6cm and a diameter of 0.4m, ensure that the settlement requirement of ≤0.10m is met. Lastly, calculations of post-treatment settlement indicate that both solutions comply with the standards, and economically, it is advisable to use cement-stabilized piles for general subgrade sections, while prestressed pipe piles should be prioritized near bridge abutments or culverts.",
