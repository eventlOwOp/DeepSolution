        "requirement": "Design of the power supply scheme for small pump stations in the \"Double High\" sugarcane base In the construction of small pump stations (installed capacity ≤500kW) at the \"High-Quality Sugarcane\" base in Guangxi, a 10 kV power supply access, transformer selection, and high-voltage side equipment configuration scheme are provided through grid power supply design to meet the pump station's operation and load requirements while reducing construction and maintenance costs.",
        "solution": "This paper proposes a design scheme for the power supply of small pump stations in dual high bases. Specifically, first, considering that pump stations are mostly in low-load areas, a 10 kV public overhead line \"T\" connection method is adopted, approved by the power supply department to ensure reliable connection to the pump stations. Second, in transformer selection, priority is given to more cost-effective oil-immersed transformers, and when harmonic suppression and single-phase load support are required, the Dyn11 wiring group is selected. By strictly calculating load and capacity formulas, unreasonable selection is avoided. Finally, in the configuration of high-voltage side switches, 10 kV vacuum circuit breakers are recommended to improve power supply reliability in combination with monitoring systems. When economic conditions are limited, drop-out fuses can be selected, but safety operation and maintenance management must be strengthened. Through the above measures, low-cost and highly reliable power supply for small pump stations is achieved, enhancing the efficiency of base construction.",

Second, to address stress concentration and insufficient bearing capacity caused by structural design defects, the enlarged cross-section reinforcement method is used. Through rebar planting on both sides (or one side), roughening the surface of the concrete, and pouring new C40 concrete, the load-bearing cross-section of the beams and columns is enlarged, enhancing the flexural and shear strength of the normal and inclined sections, ensuring the safe operation of middle bents and edge bents.

        "solution": "This paper proposes the installation plan for the inclined shaft pressure steel pipe of Jurong Pumped Storage Power Station. Specifically, first, considering the conditions such as the long inclined shaft (92.1m) and the impossibility for transport vehicles to enter the tunnel, which may pose challenges of transportation and sliding, the direct sliding technology using a double-drum hoist is adopted. Through a dual steel wire rope system, this improves construction efficiency and safety while reducing the need for tunnel roof expansion. Second, to address the complexity of welding operations during steel pipe transportation, the auxiliary installation and welding technology with a construction trolley are used. By ensuring stable locking with steel chain rings and fall protection on the trolley, the convenience of welding work and personnel safety are guaranteed. Finally, to mitigate the risk of overturning or detachment during steel pipe transportation and sliding, the overturning and welding seam strength verification technology is employed to ensure the reliability of the connection between the trolley and steel pipe, further enhancing overall construction safety. The implementation of this plan resulted in no personnel or equipment accidents in practical applications, effectively ensuring installation quality and progress, and providing significant technical support and reference experience for similar projects.",

Specifically, first, considering the challenges of flash floods, rainfall, and tidal encounters that coastal mountainous cities may face, the SWMM model technology is used to verify the scheme, combined with river channel expansion and elevation adjustment techniques to enhance the overall flood discharge capacity of the watershed. Second, addressing the current issue of inadequate drainage capacity of the water system, the drainage capacity in urban construction areas is ensured to meet design standards by optimizing stormwater pipeline design and building new pump stations. Lastly, for low-lying areas prone to waterlogging with adverse gradient river sections and insufficient pump discharge capacity, the drainage path is optimized using auxiliary road drainage technology, and the forced drainage capability of pump stations is enhanced to eliminate regional waterlogging risks. According to simulation verification, under the scenario of a 1-in-20-year rainfall encounter with a 1-in-50-year flood and tidal conditions, the proposed solution can effectively discharge 35.06 million cubic meters of runoff, achieving the flood control and drainage objectives.",

Specifically, firstly, considering that extensive damage to the slope protection and tooth wall may lead to insufficient flood discharge capacity and imbalance in the slope cross-section, concrete slope and bottom protection repair technology as well as rubble concrete + concrete tooth wall repair technology are adopted. Through rubble concrete filling, C25 concrete panel pouring, and upper concrete covering of the tooth wall, a new structure with high anti-scouring performance is constructed. Secondly, addressing the significant deepening of the scour pit at the end of the tail channel that may weaken the overall structure of the tail channel, the gabion grid anti-scour groove technology is employed. Through layered compaction of block stones and filling with anti-scour blocks, the anti-scour capability of the bottom plate and the tooth wall foot protection is reinforced, and construction efficiency is significantly improved.

Specifically, first, considering the issues of deep bedrock burial and insufficient bearing capacity in the 5 to 1 area of the inlet left wing wall, composite foundation technology using high-pressure jet grouting piles is employed. With a pile diameter of 1.00 m and a pile length extending 0.50 m into the bedrock, a total of 260 piles are arranged in a rectangular layout, along with an additional graded sand and gravel bedding layer to effectively enhance the foundation's bearing capacity, ensuring the stability and seismic resistance of the wing wall. Secondly, for the strongly weathered mudstone interlayers and poor geological conditions with sand and gravel in the 6 to 7 area of the left wing wall, rock-fill concrete technology is adopted. Dam slope protection materials are used for backfilling (at a rock-fill ratio of 30%), and C20 concrete is selected for filling to increase foundation strength and ensure safety under construction conditions. Finally, to meet the tight schedule of achieving discharge capability before the flood season of the following year, construction parameters are optimized by employing double-tube high-pressure jet grouting technology and efficient rock-fill concrete construction methods, achieving the design goals on time. The implementation of this plan not only resolved the issue of insufficient foundation bearing capacity but also effectively ensured the safety of reservoir construction during the flood season.",

        "requirement": "Design and Research on the Safety Reinforcement Scheme of a Reservoir Dam Under the conditions of a dam crest elevation of 102.16m, a maximum dam height of 30.45m, uneven fill quality, a seepage evaluation rating of B, and locally high permeability coefficients, complete the design task for the dam risk elimination and reinforcement plan, focusing on improving the compaction of the dam fill and overall stability, reducing seepage risks, and enhancing the operational safety of the dam.",
        "solution": "This paper proposes a comprehensive plan for the reinforcement and upgrading of a reservoir dam. Specifically, firstly, considering the seepage risks that may be caused by uneven backfill quality and low compaction density of the dam body, grouting technology was employed. Low-pressure gravity grouting was used to fill cracks and voids, improving the compaction and stability of the dam body. Secondly, in response to the seepage risk caused by the dam seepage rating of Grade B and improper treatment of the contact points between the backfill layer and residual soil layer, high-pressure jet grouting cutoff wall technology was adopted. High-pressure grouting formed a continuous cutoff wall, effectively blocking seepage paths. Lastly, in light of the high permeability coefficient and significant localized risks in the dam shoulders, multi-head small-diameter deep cement mixing piles were used to form an impermeable structure in the dam shoulder area, enhancing the seepage prevention performance in key areas. With these measures, the research results showed significant improvement in seepage conditions of the dam, with overall stability meeting relevant standards, providing a reference for the reinforcement and upgrading of reservoir dams.",

Specifically, first, considering that heavy rain may cause flooding and water accumulation in the construction area, diversion and interception works along with temporary pumping station technologies are adopted. Conventional flow and rainwater accumulation are managed through cofferdams to ensure the construction area remains dry. Second, to address the issue of shallow groundwater levels at the site, the wellpoint dewatering method is employed by reasonably arranging wells (16 wells, 20 meters in depth, and 20 meters apart) to stabilize the groundwater level in the construction area, ensuring the safety of the foundation pit. Finally, for the river works requiring flow control using cofferdams, a homogenous earth cofferdam technique is used. Measures such as optimizing cofferdam slope ratios (1:3 above water, 1:5 below water) and laying access roads are implemented to enhance the cofferdam’s stability and multifunctionality. Additionally, under specific conditions of heavy rain and floods, a temporary pumping station drainage plan has been designed, with each heavy rain event requiring a drainage volume of 932,200 m³, and a total of 1,864,400 m³ for the entire project duration, ensuring smooth drainage and preventing water accumulation in the construction area.",

The design must meet the 10-year flood prevention standard, ensure flood discharge capacity, and protect the villages, roads, and ecological environment on both sides.",
        "solution": "This paper proposes a plan for the design and remediation measures of the bank protection types for the main and tributary streams of Baiyun River. Specifically, first, considering the insufficient flood discharge capacity of the Baiyun River basin and the requirement for the bank protection to meet the 10-year flood standard, gabion baskets are used for bank protection. By optimizing the design of river section protection and erosion resistance, the flood discharge capacity of the Baiyun River channel is improved. Second, for the issue of limited land resources in the section near Shangdianzi River Village, cantilever concrete straight-wall bank protection technology is employed. Through a design with high stability and minimal land occupation, the protective capacity of the village section is ensured. Finally, to address the problems of poor flow erosion stability and vegetation erosion along the main stream bank of Baiyun River, gabion basket bank protection technology is used, and shrubs are planted on the slope of the bank. Through stepped reinforcement and ecological restoration, the issues of protective stability and landscape are resolved, ultimately achieving the goal of improving the overall flood discharge capacity and flood control effectiveness of the river channel.",

Second, to address the flow requirements of the Dabujing River under a 50-year flood standard, hydraulic calculations and structural optimizations are conducted to ensure a flow capacity of 176.5 m³/s, significantly exceeding the design requirements. Finally, to solve the issue of insufficient foundation bearing capacity, ground reinforcement technology is applied, using reinforced concrete square piles to effectively increase the composite foundation bearing capacity to 130.84 kPa, meeting design requirements. The plan balances safety, cost-effectiveness, and construction convenience, providing valuable reference for similar projects.",

Specifically, firstly, considering the deep soft soil underlying the foundation and the potential damage to the original slope stability caused by embankment filling, a combined technique of bored piles and cement-mixed piles is utilized. The bored piles enhance the anti-slip stability of the dike slope, and the cement-mixed piles increase the foundation soil strength, thereby improving the overall stability of the dike slope foundation. Secondly, based on the high flood control standards and cost control requirements of the Level 1 dike design, a combined composite foundation technique is adopted, involving bored piles (spacing 3m×3m, pile length 30m) and cement-mixed piles (pile diameter 0.8m, pile length 21-30m, arranged in grids or evenly). This approach ensures the overall stability and safety of the dike. Finally, through an economic and technical comparison of several foundation treatment techniques, this combined solution is identified as the optimal solution, balancing treatment effectiveness and cost-efficiency.

Specifically, first, considering surface subsidence and curvature deformation caused by coal mining, the range and operational parameters for management are determined by dynamically forecasting using the probability integral method combined with the ABAQUS model to calculate the stress distribution of the pipeline. Second, for pipeline damage caused by surface deformation, the reverse lifting method (TLB-40 type air cushion lifting) is used to restore the pipeline elevation, and buried corrugated displacement compensators are utilized to absorb axial deformation stress, ensuring pipeline safety. Finally, lateral horizontal displacement of the pipeline is addressed by incorporating lateral displacement repair technology, and the construction scope is adjusted based on dynamic forecasting.

        "solution": "This paper proposes a comprehensive anti-seepage reinforcement plan targeting the hidden dangers of seepage and landslides in long-distance earth-rock dams. Specifically, firstly, considering the poor filling quality of the dam body leading to the formation of seepage channels, a multi-head small diameter cement mixing pile diaphragm wall technology is employed for vertical anti-seepage in regions where the dam height is less than 15 meters. By adjusting the permeability coefficient and consolidating the wall, a low water head anti-seepage system is established. Secondly, for areas with higher permeability in local contact sections, high-pressure jet grouting anti-seepage wall technology is adopted for regions where the dam height exceeds 15 meters. Through the consolidation of the body to strengthen the integrity of the dam, the anti-compression capacity against seepage is significantly improved. Lastly, considering the high seepage exit height in some sections, a slope-attached drainage and reverse filter layer technique is used. The reverse filter is applied within 1.5 meters above the seepage exit point on the downstream slope, and a layered drainage design ensures that the infiltration line on the downstream slope is significantly lowered, thus meeting regulatory requirements.
