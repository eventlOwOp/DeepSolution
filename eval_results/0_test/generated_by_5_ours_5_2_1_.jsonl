Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n3. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard).

By using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it ensures that dust emissions are below 8 mg/m³ (standard).\n5. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate.

Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n2. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n3. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard).

Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n12. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n13. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n14. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO.

This solution ensures all emission levels meet the required standards.\n\n<Reference>:\n1. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n2. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n3. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of high nitrogen oxide emissions from the boiler body, which may result in the boiler's NOx emissions failing to meet the emission standards.\n4. New ultra-low emission filter bag dust removal technology This technology is suitable for high-efficiency dust filtration. By using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it ensures that dust emissions are below 8 mg/m³ (standard).\n5. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n6. Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n7. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n8. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n9. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n10. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n11. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n12. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n13. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n\n### Highly Useful References\n\n1. **Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology**  \n   - This technology is directly relevant to reducing NOx emissions to the required 45 mg/m³ standard.

However, it does not mention the additional challenge of high NOx emissions from the boiler body, which can make it difficult to meet the 45 mg/m³ standard. The reference indicates that boiler body NOx emissions can be high, and the candidate solution should address this specific issue.\n   - Additionally, the candidate solution mentions using SNCR but does not provide details on how to ensure that the NOx emissions are reduced to the required level. The reference suggests that SNCR can reduce NOx emissions to 45 mg/m³ but does not provide a clear plan for implementation.\n\n2. **SO2 Reduction:**\n   - The candidate solution proposes enhancing limestone-gypsum wet desulfurization by increasing the slurry pool and gypsum retention time. However, it does not address the challenge of fluctuating SO2 emissions and the lag in feed rate relative to coal feed rate. The reference mentions that the existing desulfurization system may not keep up with fluctuating SO2 levels, which could lead to non-compliance with the 28 mg/m³ standard.\n   - The candidate solution does not discuss specific control strategies or adaptations to manage these fluctuations, which are critical for maintaining compliance.\n\n3. **Dust Emission Reduction:**\n   - The candidate solution suggests replacing existing dust collectors with ultrafine fiber filter bags, which is a good approach. However, it does not consider the challenge of the existing dust collector's insufficient efficiency, as mentioned in the reference. This could lead to dust emissions failing to meet the 8 mg/m³ standard, especially if the existing collector is not modified or replaced thoroughly.\n\n#### Technical Implementation:\n1. **NOx Reduction:**\n   - The candidate solution lacks a detailed plan for addressing high NOx emissions from the boiler body. It is essential to include strategies such as low-NOx burners, water-cooled wind chambers, and SNCR, and provide a clear timeline and implementation plan.\n   - The candidate solution should also include specific performance metrics and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that NOx emissions are consistently below the 45 mg/m³ standard.\n\n2. **SO2 Reduction:**\n   - The candidate solution should include advanced control strategies to manage fluctuating SO2 emissions. This could involve real-time monitoring and adaptive control systems to adjust the limestone feeding rate and desulfurization efficiency.\n   - The candidate solution should also consider the use of limestone automatic feeding systems to enhance the timeliness and stability of limestone feeding, as suggested by the reference.\n\n3. **Dust Emission Reduction:**\n   - The candidate solution should provide a detailed plan for replacing the existing dust collectors, including the specific model and efficiency of the new ultrafine fiber filter bags.\n   - The candidate solution should also include a plan for performance testing and validation to ensure that the new dust collectors meet the 8 mg/m³ standard.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Enhance NOx Reduction Plan:**\n   - Include additional measures such as water-cooled wall replacement and detailed performance metrics for NOx emissions.\n   - Implement SNCR with clear performance indicators and monitoring mechanisms.\n\n2. **Improve SO2 Reduction Plan:**\n   - Develop advanced control strategies to manage fluctuating SO2 emissions.\n   - Integrate limestone automatic feeding systems to improve desulfurization efficiency.\n\n3. **Optimize Dust Emission Reduction Plan:**\n   - Provide a detailed plan for replacing the existing dust collectors with ultrafine fiber filter bags.\n   - Include performance testing and validation to ensure compliance with the 8 mg/m³ standard.\n\nBy addressing these shortcomings and incorporating the detailed recommendations, the retrofit plan can more effectively meet the stringent emission standards for NOx, SO2, and dust emissions.", "reflection_input": "<Instruction>: \nFor the following question, a candidate solution has already been provided.

Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n2. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n3. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of high nitrogen oxide emissions from the boiler body, which may result in the boiler's NOx emissions failing to meet the emission standards.\n4. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n5. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas).

By using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it ensures that dust emissions are below 8 mg/m³ (standard).\n7. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used.

Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n15.

However, the reference states that SNCR alone can reduce NOx to 140 mg/m³, and oxy-combustion further reduces it to 45 mg/m³. The candidate solution seems to imply that SNCR can achieve 45 mg/m³ directly, which is not the case. This could mislead the reader into thinking that SNCR alone is sufficient, which is not accurate.\n   - **No Mention of Oxy-Combustion Drawbacks**: Oxy-combustion is a highly energy-intensive process with high operational costs and potential safety concerns. The candidate solution does not mention these drawbacks, which are critical for a comprehensive and realistic plan.\n\n2. **SO2 Reduction**:\n   - **Enhanced Absorption Tower Efficiency**: The candidate solution mentions enhanced absorption tower efficiency and advanced control strategies. However, the reference indicates that the existing desulfurization system may lack modification interfaces, have complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space. The candidate solution does not address these challenges, which could lead to project delays and increased costs.\n   - **Feed Rate Lag**: The reference mentions that the feed rate lags behind the changes in coal feed rate, which can lead to SO2 emissions exceeding limits. The candidate solution does not provide a strategy to address this issue, which is a significant operational challenge.\n\n3. **Dust Emission Reduction**:\n   - **No Mention of Existing Collector Efficiency**: The candidate solution assumes an existing dust collector with sufficient efficiency. However, the reference states that the existing dust collector may not be efficient enough, which could lead to dust emissions failing to meet the standards. The candidate solution does not address the need to assess and possibly improve the current dust collector's performance.\n   - **Ultrafine Fiber Filter Bags**: While the candidate solution mentions the use of ultrafine fiber filter bags, it does not provide details on the installation process, maintenance requirements, or potential limitations in achieving the 8 mg/m³ standard.\n\n4. **Project Management**:\n   - **Risk Management Plans**: The candidate solution outlines risk management plans, modular construction techniques, and budget allocations. However, it does not provide specific details on how these plans will be implemented or what the potential risks are.\n   - **Continuous Monitoring**: While the candidate solution mentions continuous monitoring, it does not specify the frequency, equipment, or personnel training requirements for monitoring, which are crucial for ensuring compliance.\n\n5. **Lack of Specific Technical Details**:\n   - **No Detailed Technical Specifications**: The solution does not provide detailed technical specifications for the technologies proposed, such as the type of filter bags, the configuration of the absorption tower, or the specific control strategies for SO2 emissions. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed solutions.\n   - **No Mention of Integration Challenges**: The reference indicates that the existing systems have limitations that could complicate the retrofit process. The candidate solution does not address these integration challenges, which could lead to project delays and higher costs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile the candidate solution provides a good initial framework for the ultra-low emission retrofit plan, it lacks detailed technical specifications, does not address specific challenges and limitations, and does not provide a comprehensive risk assessment. The solution needs to be more detailed and realistic to ensure that the challenges are properly addressed and that the proposed technologies are feasible and effective.", "reflection_input": "<Instruction>: \nFor the following question, a candidate solution has already been provided.

Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n2. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n3. New ultra-low emission filter bag dust removal technology This technology is suitable for high-efficiency dust filtration. By using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it ensures that dust emissions are below 8 mg/m³ (standard).\n4. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of high nitrogen oxide emissions from the boiler body, which may result in the boiler's NOx emissions failing to meet the emission standards.\n5. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n6. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n7. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n8. Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n9. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n10. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n11. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n12. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n13. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n14. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n15.

SNCR typically achieves lower NOx reductions (around 30-50%) compared to LNOx (up to 70% reduction). The reference material suggests that even with SNCR, NOx emissions can only be reduced to 45 mg/m³ after the initial reduction by LNOx, indicating that SNCR alone might not be sufficient.\n   - **Missing Specific LNOx Retrofit Details**: The plan does not explain the specific LNOx retrofit technologies (e.g., water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, water-cooled wall replacement) that will be implemented, which are crucial for achieving NOx reductions to ≤ 45 mg/m³.\n\n2. **SO2 Emission Reduction**:\n   - **Complexity and Cost**: The plan mentions the challenges of complex equipment and pipeline arrangements and limited construction space, which could lead to increased costs and delays. The reference material highlights these challenges and suggests the need for advanced control strategies and possibly oxy-combustion technology, which are not mentioned.\n   - **Fluctuating SO2 Emissions**: The plan does not address the issue of fluctuating SO2 emissions due to changes in coal feed rate. The reference material suggests that improving the limestone feeding system (Limestone automatic feeding system improvement) could help, which is not included in the candidate solution.\n\n3. **Dust Emission Reduction**:\n   - **Efficiency of Existing Dust Collector**: The plan does not mention the existing dust collector's efficiency and whether it needs to be upgraded or replaced. The reference material indicates that the existing dust collector might be insufficient, which is a critical oversight.\n   - **Ultrafine Fiber Filter Bags**: While the plan suggests using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it does not provide details on installation and maintenance, which are essential for long-term performance.\n\n4. **Project Management**:\n   - **Risk Management**: While the plan mentions developing a detailed project plan and managing risks, it does not specify the types of risks that will be managed or the methods for mitigating them.\n   - **Cost Optimization**: The plan mentions optimizing construction methods to minimize costs, but it does not provide specific cost-saving measures or strategies.\n\n5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:\n   - **Continuous Emission Monitoring**: The plan emphasizes the importance of continuous emission monitoring, which is crucial. However, it does not specify the exact monitoring technologies and tools that will be used or how the data will be analyzed and utilized to ensure compliance.\n   - **Operator Training**: While operator training is important, the plan does not provide a detailed training program or outline the specific topics that will be covered.\n\n### Recommendations:\n1. **Enhance NOx Emission Reduction**:\n   - Implement LNOx retrofit technologies (e.g., water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, water-cooled wall replacement) to achieve the required NOx reduction.\n   - Consider oxy-combustion technology for further NOx reduction.\n\n2. **Improve SO2 Emission Reduction**:\n   - Address the challenges of fluctuating SO2 emissions by improving the limestone feeding system and implementing advanced control strategies.\n   - Consider oxy-combustion technology for SO2 reduction, especially in areas with high sulfur content in coal.\n\n3. **Optimize Dust Emission Reduction**:\n   - Assess the efficiency of the existing dust collector and consider upgrading or replacing it with ultrafine fiber filter bags.\n   - Provide details on the installation and maintenance of ultrafine fiber filter bags.\n\n4. **Refine Project Management**:\n   - Specify the types of risks that will be managed and the methods for mitigating them.\n   - Provide specific cost-saving measures and strategies.\n\n5. **Expand Monitoring and Evaluation**:\n   - Specify the exact monitoring technologies and tools that will be used.\n   - Provide a detailed operator training program with specific topics to be covered.\n\nBy addressing these shortcomings, the candidate solution can be further strengthened to ensure a more robust and effective ultra-low emission retrofit plan.", "reflection_input": "<Instruction>: \nFor the following question, a candidate solution has already been provided.

Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n2. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard).

By using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it ensures that dust emissions are below 8 mg/m³ (standard).\n4. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n5. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n6. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n7. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n8.

Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n11. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n12. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n13. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n14. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO.

Key strategies include:  1. **NOx Reduction**:    - Implement Low-NOx Burners (LNOx) and Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) to reduce NOx emissions to ≤ 45 mg/m³.    - Consider oxy-combustion technology for further reduction.  2. **SO2 Reduction**:    - Enhance limestone-gypsum wet desulfurization systems by improving absorption tower efficiency and implementing advanced control strategies.  3. **Dust Emission Reduction**:    - Install ultrafine fiber filter bags and optimize dust collection systems to achieve ≤ 8 mg/m³ emissions.  4. **Project Management**:    - Develop a detailed project plan, manage risks, and optimize construction methods to minimize costs and disruptions.  5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**:    - Implement continuous emission monitoring systems and conduct regular training for operators.  This plan ensures compliance with emission standards through systematic project management, efficient technology implementation, and ongoing monitoring.\n\n<Reference>:\n1. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n2. the original nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions are 350 mg/m³ and need to be reduced to 45 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of high nitrogen oxide emissions from the boiler body, which may result in the boiler's NOx emissions failing to meet the emission standards.\n3. New ultra-low emission filter bag dust removal technology This technology is suitable for high-efficiency dust filtration. By using ultrafine fiber filter bags, it ensures that dust emissions are below 8 mg/m³ (standard).\n4. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n5. Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n6. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n7. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n8. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n9. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n10. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n11. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n12. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n13. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n14. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n15.

Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n2. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n3. Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n4. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n5. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n6. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n7. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n8. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n9. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n10. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n11. the total salt content and sulfate concentration in the discharge water of the cooling cycle system exceed standards, and the power plant is located in the water-scarce central region of the North China Plain, requiring a reduction in concentration ratios to meet local environmental protection standards. Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n\n### Highly Useful References:\n1. **Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing.

When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n14.

Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n16. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO.

Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n6. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n7. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n8. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n9. the total salt content and sulfate concentration in the discharge water of the cooling cycle system exceed standards, and the power plant is located in the water-scarce central region of the North China Plain, requiring a reduction in concentration ratios to meet local environmental protection standards. Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n10. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n11. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n12. Investigation Techniques for Ecological and Environmental Protection Measures This technology is suitable for verifying the ecological environment impact and the implementation of protective measures, including surface vegetation, soil and water loss, and mine water treatment, and can achieve detailed assessments of ecological restoration and protection effects during the construction and operation periods.\n13. The conditions for the project include the mine and the coal washing plant, and the project was completed in October 2018, capable of joint operation. Under these conditions, conducting an environmental acceptance survey will face challenges related to the complexity of coordinating the ecological, groundwater, atmospheric, water environment, and noise environment interactions between the mine and the coal washing plant, as well as the implementation of verification measures, which may result in an incomplete reflection of the effectiveness of environmental protection measures.\n14. Reverse osmosis technology This technology is suitable for the desalination of circulating water bypass, providing high-quality freshwater for boiler make-up and circulating water, but the high chloride ion concentration in the brine affects the desulfurization efficiency.\n15. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n16. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n17. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n18. ### Summary  #### Project Overview and Objectives The project aims to expand and renovate the wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system at a 3 × 210 MW coal-fired power plant to achieve a desulfurization efficiency of 97.5%, in compliance with Turkey's stringent environmental standards.  #### Challenges and Solutions 1. **Limited Modification Interfaces and Complex Equipment Arrangements**    - **Solution**: Advanced 3D modeling and modular components for precise placement and efficient space utilization.

Be sure to make full use of reference knowledge to analyze the challenges contained within the question and provide a comprehensive solution.\n\n<Question>:\nDesign of capacity expansion and renovation scheme for the wet flue gas desulfurization system of a 3 × 210 MW coal-fired power plant Under Turkey's strict environmental standards and the conditions of burning high-sulfur coal, completing the capacity expansion and renovation of the 3 × 210 MW desulfurization unit requires achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97.5% and completing the task on the existing facilities.\n\n<Reference>:\n1. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n2. Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n3. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n4. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n5. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n6. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n7. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n8. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n9. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n10. Reverse osmosis technology This technology is suitable for the desalination of circulating water bypass, providing high-quality freshwater for boiler make-up and circulating water, but the high chloride ion concentration in the brine affects the desulfurization efficiency.\n11. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n12. Investigation Techniques for Ecological and Environmental Protection Measures This technology is suitable for verifying the ecological environment impact and the implementation of protective measures, including surface vegetation, soil and water loss, and mine water treatment, and can achieve detailed assessments of ecological restoration and protection effects during the construction and operation periods.\n13. the total salt content and sulfate concentration in the discharge water of the cooling cycle system exceed standards, and the power plant is located in the water-scarce central region of the North China Plain, requiring a reduction in concentration ratios to meet local environmental protection standards. Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n14. The conditions for the project include the mine and the coal washing plant, and the project was completed in October 2018, capable of joint operation. Under these conditions, conducting an environmental acceptance survey will face challenges related to the complexity of coordinating the ecological, groundwater, atmospheric, water environment, and noise environment interactions between the mine and the coal washing plant, as well as the implementation of verification measures, which may result in an incomplete reflection of the effectiveness of environmental protection measures.\n15. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n16. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n17. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n18. ### Summary  #### Project Overview and Objectives The project aims to expand and renovate the wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) system at a 3 × 210 MW coal-fired power plant to achieve a desulfurization efficiency of 97.5%, in compliance with Turkey's stringent environmental standards.  #### Challenges and Solutions 1. **Limited Modification Interfaces and Complex Equipment Arrangements**    - **Solution**: Advanced 3D modeling and modular components for precise placement and efficient space utilization.

Key challenges include limited modification interfaces and complex equipment arrangements, which are addressed through advanced 3D modeling, modular components, and limestone-gypsum wet desulfurization technology.

Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n2. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n3. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n4. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n5. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n6. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n7. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n8. Reverse osmosis technology This technology is suitable for the desalination of circulating water bypass, providing high-quality freshwater for boiler make-up and circulating water, but the high chloride ion concentration in the brine affects the desulfurization efficiency.\n9. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n10. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n11. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n12. the total salt content and sulfate concentration in the discharge water of the cooling cycle system exceed standards, and the power plant is located in the water-scarce central region of the North China Plain, requiring a reduction in concentration ratios to meet local environmental protection standards. Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n13. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n14. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n15. Investigation Techniques for Ecological and Environmental Protection Measures This technology is suitable for verifying the ecological environment impact and the implementation of protective measures, including surface vegetation, soil and water loss, and mine water treatment, and can achieve detailed assessments of ecological restoration and protection effects during the construction and operation periods.\n16. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO.

Key solutions include: 1. **Enhanced Desulfurization Efficiency**: Implementing advanced control systems and limestone automatic feeding systems. 2. **Modular and Efficient Design**: Using modular components and 3D modeling for precise placement. 3. **Wastewater Treatment Upgrades**: Upgrading to a 200,000 tons/day capacity with nanofiltration technology. 4. **Dust Collector Upgrades**: Enhancing dust collection systems. 5. **Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit**: Reducing NOx emissions through advanced technologies. 6. **Environmental Monitoring**: Deploying SCADA systems and real-time compliance technologies.  The implementation plan includes feasibility studies, preliminary design, procurement, installation, commissioning, and operational optimization. Milestones are set for each phase, with the project timeline spanning 24 months, from feasibility studies to operational optimization and continuous monitoring.\n\n<Reference>:\n1. Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing. Under these conditions, it is necessary to modify the existing desulfurization system to meet lower SO2 emission standards. The challenges include a lack of modification interfaces, complex equipment and pipeline arrangements, and limited construction space, which may lead to difficulties in project implementation and increased costs.\n2. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n3. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n4.

Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n6. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n7. Limestone-Gypsum Wet Desulfurization Technology This technology is suitable for treating waste gas with SO2 concentrations of up to 1200 mg/Nm3, using limestone as a desulfurizing agent, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of over 95%, and producing high-purity gypsum by-products that can be used as a water-retaining agent in cement.\n8. Limestone automatic feeding system improvement This technology is applicable for improving desulfurization efficiency within the furnace. By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n9. The conditions for the project include the mine and the coal washing plant, and the project was completed in October 2018, capable of joint operation. Under these conditions, conducting an environmental acceptance survey will face challenges related to the complexity of coordinating the ecological, groundwater, atmospheric, water environment, and noise environment interactions between the mine and the coal washing plant, as well as the implementation of verification measures, which may result in an incomplete reflection of the effectiveness of environmental protection measures.\n10. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n11. Absorption tower and its auxiliary system renovation technology This technology is applicable for retrofitting based on existing absorption towers. By raising the slurry pool of the absorption tower and increasing the gypsum retention time, it improves the conversion rate from CaSO3 to CaSO4, achieving a desulfurization efficiency of 97%~98%.\n12. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n13. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n14. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n15. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n16. Reverse osmosis technology This technology is suitable for the desalination of circulating water bypass, providing high-quality freshwater for boiler make-up and circulating water, but the high chloride ion concentration in the brine affects the desulfurization efficiency.\n17. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n\n### Highly Useful References\n\n1. **Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing.

By improving the limestone feeding system and its control logic, it enhances feeding timeliness and stabilizes SO2 emissions.\n5. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions fluctuate greatly. Although the desulfurization capacity in the furnace meets the ultra-low emission requirements, the feed rate lags behind changes in coal feed rate. Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of exceeding SO2 emissions limits, which may result in failing to meet environmental emission standards.\n6. the SO2 emission concentration in the cement kiln flue gas is relatively high. When the SO2 emission concentration is around 400 mg/Nm3 (general areas) or 200 mg/Nm3 (key areas), different raw material mills are used. Under these conditions, not using appropriate desulfurization technology may lead to excessive SO2 emissions, especially when a ball mill is used in the raw material mill, where only about 50% of the exhaust gases enter the mill, resulting in low SO2 removal efficiency.\n7. Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n8. the total salt content and sulfate concentration in the discharge water of the cooling cycle system exceed standards, and the power plant is located in the water-scarce central region of the North China Plain, requiring a reduction in concentration ratios to meet local environmental protection standards. Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n9. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n10. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n11. Reverse osmosis technology This technology is suitable for the desalination of circulating water bypass, providing high-quality freshwater for boiler make-up and circulating water, but the high chloride ion concentration in the brine affects the desulfurization efficiency.\n12. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n13. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n14. Investigation Techniques for Ecological and Environmental Protection Measures This technology is suitable for verifying the ecological environment impact and the implementation of protective measures, including surface vegetation, soil and water loss, and mine water treatment, and can achieve detailed assessments of ecological restoration and protection effects during the construction and operation periods.\n15. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n16. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n\nBased on the provided references and the specific requirements for the capacity expansion and renovation scheme for the wet flue gas desulfurization system, I will categorize the references into highly useful and less useful groups.\n\n### Highly Useful References\n1. **Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing.

Nanofiltration technology This technology is suitable for reducing the concentration of salts and sulfate in circulating wastewater, enabling compliance with emission standards and allowing the concentrated water to be reused as desulfurization process water.\n9. Environmental monitoring and evaluation technology This technology is applicable for monitoring atmospheric, water, noise environment, and solid waste emissions within the project area, implemented in accordance with the technical specifications (HJ 672—2013), and assesses the impact of pollutant emissions on the environment through improvement measures and remedial plans.\n10. the raw material mill has not employed a suitable SO2 reduction device, which may result in SO2 emission concentrations exceeding 500 mg/Nm3 (in ordinary areas). Under these conditions, high SO2 emissions may lead to non-compliance with emission standards, especially when the raw material mill deviates from the optimal configuration, making it impossible to effectively eliminate SO2.\n11. Reverse osmosis technology This technology is suitable for the desalination of circulating water bypass, providing high-quality freshwater for boiler make-up and circulating water, but the high chloride ion concentration in the brine affects the desulfurization efficiency.\n12. the total salt content and sulfate concentration in the discharge water of the cooling cycle system exceed standards, and the power plant is located in the water-scarce central region of the North China Plain, requiring a reduction in concentration ratios to meet local environmental protection standards. Under these conditions, the sewage treatment will face the risk of exceeding emission standards and high water consumption, which may lead to serious environmental accountability and resource waste.\n13. dust emissions exceed the standard and need to be below 8 mg/m³ (standard). Under these conditions, the modification will face the challenge of insufficient efficiency of the existing dust collector, which may result in dust emissions failing to meet the standards.\n14. the existing wastewater treatment plant serves a population that exceeds the designed scale and the wastewater treatment capacity far exceeds the designed capacity, with the current scale being 100,000 tons/day, which needs to be increased to 200,000 tons/day. Under these conditions, upgrading and expanding the project will face the challenge of the effluent water quality not meeting the \"Guangdong Province Water Pollutant Discharge Standards\" and national standards, which may lead to failure in meeting environmental protection standards, requiring optimization of facilities to enhance processing capacity.\n15. Boiler Low-NOx Combustion Retrofit Technology This technology is applicable for reducing boiler NOx emissions. Through measures such as water-cooled wind chamber, secondary air system modification, and water-cooled wall replacement, NOx emissions are reduced to 140 mg/m³ (standard) and further improved to 45 mg/m³ through SNCR.\n16. The condition involves the presence of volatile sulfur compounds in the exhaust, which may escape during the preheating stage and fail to react adequately with the highly reactive CaO. Under these conditions, it may result in SO2 not being effectively removed during the preheating process, leading to increased emission concentrations that cannot meet the emission standards.\n\n### Highly Useful References\n\n1. **Turkey's increasingly stringent environmental standards require a reduction in SO2 emissions, and the sulfur content in coal entering the furnace is increasing.
